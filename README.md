# Description

This landing page project (from The Odin Project) is designed to simulate a real website's landing page. It will demonstrate my knowledge of HTML and CSS.

# Thoughts upon finishing (for now) 

It seems like it would be much easier (for the next time I make a website) to identify common styles shared by different elements before I start coding. Because I added the sections of this site one-by-one, I ended up writing a fair amount of redundant CSS, which I then had to re-organize. Next time, I'd like to identify which elements will have dark text or bold or a certain font size (etc.) and then add those styles as classes as I'm writing the HTML.

Also, I would like to change this page so that it displays better at smaller window sizes. I got it to look nice for my computer's window size, but I want it to look good at other window sizes, too. I imagine that this would require me to use flexboxes more efficiently than I have already.
